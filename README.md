There is my first multiclass classification model using transfer learning. 
It's reach about 95% accuracy on gender recognition and about 90% in predicting age.


There are 2 files one:
GenderAndAgeRec - it's file where i prepared data for learning and import pre-trained models. Data is downloaded from kaggle.
testing_face_gender_rec - it's file where i tested pretrained and saved models on my own data.
